## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place throughout December, featuring a series of programming puzzles that test your problem-solving and coding skills. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants solve it using their preferred programming language.

Official Website: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Repository Structure

- **/dayX**: Each day of the event has its own directory containing the puzzle input and my solution(s) to the problem.
  - `/dayX/input.txt`: Puzzle input provided for the day.
  - `/dayX/part1`: Solution to the first part of the puzzle.
  - `/dayX/part2`: Solution to the second part of the puzzle.

- **/utils**: Common utility functions or scripts that are reused across multiple days.

    ```

2. Navigate to the specific day's directory:

    ```bash
